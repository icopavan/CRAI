     Model from Wang Giannakis "Wireless Multicarrier Comm"

This model provides a general framework for OFDM-based wireless
communications. It is derived from the work from Wang-Giannakis
adapted to a general representation of more recent wireless 
standards. The set of multiple access schemes which can be 
represented with this model are:

OFDMA
CDMA
MC-CDMA
SC-FDMA

The represented environment is a set of M transmitters and M
receivers, with MxM wide set of time-domain impulse responses
representing many of the possible SISO/MIMO combinations of a 
reference systems. Depending on the relative location of the
receivers and transmitters, the following situation can be 
modeled:

Uplink for a cellular system
(rx co-located at basestation and tx scattered around)

Downlink for a cellular system
(tx co-located at BS and rx scattered)

MIMO systems
(tx and rx grouped)

*** Simulation and data reporting scripts ***

Follow these steps to run simulations:

1) edit source.me.noinput and change master GSL_RNG_SEED
2) prepare param files in params/ folder
3) ./launcher ./run-crai params/pattern*
4) [optional] ./atq-clear removes all pending batch processes

These steps to show results:

1) launch gnuplot [interactive mode]
2) gnunplot> load 'analyzer/gmccdma-ai/crai.gnu'
3) [optional] gnuplot> set term pdfcairo
4) set output 'figure-name.pdf'
5) replot
